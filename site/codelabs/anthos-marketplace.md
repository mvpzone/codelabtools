# 206 - Anthos Marketplace Lab

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Overview

Duration: 4

Google Cloud Marketplace lets you quickly deploy functional software packages that run on Google Cloud and Anthos. Marketplace for Anthos can start up a familiar software package without having to manually configure the software, pods, storage, or network settings. You can deploy a software package, reconfigure and scale that deployment later when the apps require additional resources.

You can browse available Anthos/Kubernetes marketplace offerings [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:k8s&filter=deployment-env:anthos&_ga=2.62283876.912462658.1596769275-1489993943.1594165045).

## Deploy Anthos Marketplace Application

Duration: 5

In this lab you will search and deploy nginx software package onto an Anthos GKE cluster. You will reuse your existing cluster.

Instructions to deploy a martketplace application can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/kubernetes-apps).

> If you want to deploy a Kubernetes application to non-GKE cluster configurations, such as an Anthos cluster running [Anthos GKE on-prem](https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem), or a cluster running [ASM](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/service-mesh)/[Istio](https://istio.io/), you must complete the tasks as outlined [here](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/kubernetes-apps/deploying-non-gke-clusters#deploy-istio).
